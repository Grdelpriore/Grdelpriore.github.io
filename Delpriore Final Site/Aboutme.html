  <h2>I am Gianluca Del Priore but I prefer to use just "Luca." I was born in Brooklyn and then moved to Irvington, New York. I then moved to Indianapolis, Indiana and then to Manhattan and then Honolulu, Hawaii and then back to Brooklyn. I despise moving. While I lived in Honolulu I got a DSLR camera. I took many photos of the beachs and plants in Hawaii. When I moved back to Brooklyn I continued to take photos. I enjoy taking photos of nature and architecture. I also play lots of video games. My favorite game genre is survival sandbox games, like Minecraft and Terraria. I am a Multimedia Programming and Design Major. </h2>
